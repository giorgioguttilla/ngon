AU prismizer plugin for Logic Pro.

This plugin is meant to emulate the effect used by artists such as Bon Iver, Frank Ocean, and Kanye West wherein the voice is autotuned, duplicated, and pitch-shifted to snap to notes in a chord, producing a lovely yet robotic choral arrangement that can be played live via MIDI inputs.

Please feel free to use in your projects, or fork and edit as you wish. Performance is a limiting factor, so I recommend bouncing clips and compiling if you want large chords.

To use, simply add to your list of Audio Units and add the plugin as a MIDI instrument within Logic.
